## Additional Course Information

- Each student should be intimately familiar with the contents of any
  work submitted for grading, whether they are the sole author, or one
  of several. The instructor shall have the right to request adequate
  **verbal explanation of methodology and content** from any student,
  for any work they submit. Credit will not be awarded when such an
  explanation is requested but not satisfactorily provided. Excellence
  in technical communication both verbally and in writing is a central
  learning objective of this course.

  - **Student Ombudsperson:** Should you have a concern about this
    course that cannot be answered by the instructor, or which pertains
    to unjust or discriminatory treatment, please contact our
    third-party department representative, Ilse Rosales (Martinez)
    Cooper <ilse.rosalesmartinez@utsa.edu>, who can assist with an
    investigation and resolution of the matter.

## Assessments and assignments

### Written assignments

Written assignments will be due every week or two. Submissions should be
typeset using [`\LaTeX`{=latex}]{.underline} or similar specialized
software (TeXmacs, LyX). All submissions are to be handed in
**hardcopy** by the specified deadline; **no extensions**.

Use of AI is allowed in **translating** content produced in some
format---perhaps handwritten or hand-drawn---to LaTeX; however, AI is
**disallowed** as a tool to **generate/create** the content proper
(e.g., solutions, proofs or essays). Read the *Guidelines for the Use of
Generative Artificial Intelligence* below for more details.

### Midterm oral/class presentations

Week of 3/16--3/20.

### Final presentations and final paper due.

Monday 11 May, 5:00--6:50 PM.

## Activities and grading

### Weight of course activities

- Homework: 50%
- Midterm presentation: 20%
- Final presentation: 15%
- Final paper: 15%

NOTE: Numerical grades of undergraduate students (enrolled in MAT 4953)
will be multiplied by 1.25 when reporting midterm and final grades.

### Final grade ranks

  ------------------ ------------------ ------------------ ---------------- ---------------
  A: \[90%, 100%\]   B+: \[80%, 85%)    C+: \[69%, 72%)    D: \[50%, 60%)   F: \[0%, 50%)
  A--: \[85%, 90%)   B: \[76%, 80%)     C: \[65%, 69%)                      
                     B--: \[72%, 76%)   C--: \[60%, 65%)                    
  ------------------ ------------------ ------------------ ---------------- ---------------

### Notes

- The lowest (or missing) **single** grade among assignments will be
  dropped in computing the homework average.
- There is no "make-up" provision to redo any for-credit course
  activities.
- *No extensions* will be granted (barring specific circumstances
  dictated by University policy).

### Time commitment expectations

MAT 4953/MAT 6973 is a cross-listed (upper-level
undergraduate/master\'s) course. The expected *average* time commitment
to this course (which varies week by week) is about **12 hours per
week**, but no less than 10 hours per week.

- **Attend** class meetings (**3 hours per week**).
- Class preparation and reading the assigned sections of the textbook
  (**2--3 hours per week**).
- Solving homework and writing (**3--4 hours per week**).
- Meet and discuss class material with your peer study group (**1--2
  hours per week**).
- Attend office hours (**1--2 hours per week**).

## Guidelines for the Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is allowed in this course
**only** as an aid in coding, and as an aid to writing (grammatical and
stylistic aspects, spelling sentence structure, organization), but
**not** to generate content proper. It remains the students\'
responsibility to properly acknowledge and credit all uses of AI.
AI-aided search of information on the internet (e.g., Gemini summaries)
is generally allowed. It remains the students\' responsibility to verify
and ensure the correctness and veracity of any information provided by
AI, obtained from websites, or otherwise not directly authored by the
students themselves. Any use of AI for purposes not explicitly allowed
(e.g., uses to generate written content such as mathematical proofs) is
deemed a violation of the Student Code of Conduct and is subject to
applicable University sanctions.

## Course expectations and policies

### Instructor-Initiated Drops

This course uses instructor-initiated drops for students who exceed the
absence and/or missed quiz limit. Up to the last withdrawal day from an
individual course, students will be dropped for **either** exceeding
*three (3) missed graded activities* **or** *five (5) missed class
meetings*. *Attending* a class meeting is defined as being present for
*at least 90% of its duration*. Students will receive at least one
courtesy warning when approaching the absence/missed limit. Notification
will be sent using ASAP to the student's email address. A subsequent
absence or missed assignment will result in being dropped from the
course. Notification of being dropped will also be sent through ASAP to
the student's email address. This drop does not affect enrollment in
other courses. Please consult the Dropping Courses website for further
details on the process and appeals.

### Video and Audio Recording

As the instructor of this course, I may record meetings and lessons. You
are expected to follow appropriate University policies and maintain the
security of passwords used to access recorded lectures. Recordings may
not be published, reproduced, or shared with those not in the class. If
the instructor or a UTSA office plans any other uses for the recordings,
consent of the students identifiable in the recordings is required
before such use unless an exception is allowed by law. For more
information on your privacy and class recordings, review Student Privacy
(FERPA) in Virtual Classrooms and Other Educational Recordings and the
Guide to Secure Video Conferencing Tools.

### Syllabus Changes

The syllabus is subject to change at the instructor's discretion. Any
changes/corrections to the course materials, assignment dates, or other
updates will be communicated to the students ahead of time. You are
responsible for checking Canvas for corrections or updates to the
syllabus.
