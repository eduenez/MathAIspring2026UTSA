# Guidelines for written work in this class

You should use *technical typesetting software*.
The standard software is LaTeX;
I have written a [Guide to Typesetting Mathematics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _refdocs/typesetting/typesetting_math.md %}) to help preparing your written work. 
<!-- (In upper-level courses, submission of typeset written is be required.) -->

Per the [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link syllabus.md %}), it is *strictly forbidden to use any AI assistance* (including LLMs) in generating the content proper of any work submitted for a grade;
however, *AI-assisted typesetting* (i.e., automatic aid in formatting or converting your authored content for LaTeX typesetting) is allowed.
The best LLMs for this purpose (as of spring 2026) are [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app){:target="_blank"}.

Written work not substantially following the guidelines will be **returned without grading**.

## *Required* Reading

- [Mathematics style guidelines and *“What* **Not** *To Do”*,](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2w6tetgratl6id8/How_to_Write_Mathematics_E_Bloch.pdf?raw=1){:target="_blank"}
  by Prof. Ethan Bloch (Bard College) in his book *“Proofs and Fundamentals”*.

- Read the first section (§1, pp. 1–6) of [*“Mathematical
Writing”*](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kd2i1hcmdbtuun1anpbe3/Knuth-Larrabee-Roberts_Mathematical_writing.pdf?rlkey=6bev0edbq8mqjun1tw70kvszv&raw=1){:target="_blank"},
by Donald Knuth, Tracy Larrabee, and Paul M. Roberts. (Don Knuth,
creator of the TeX typesetting system, is a pre-eminent computer
scientist and world leader in technical writing.)

## Supplementary Reading
- The entire document [*“Mathematical
Writing”*](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kd2i1hcmdbtuun1anpbe3/Knuth-Larrabee-Roberts_Mathematical_writing.pdf?rlkey=6bev0edbq8mqjun1tw70kvszv&raw=1){:target="_blank"} above has 43 sections (§1–§43) and is over 100 pp. long. 
  Read —and reread— portions of it little bits at a time.

- [Basic advice on writing mathematics proofs](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g6yznhm6jp9ap5k/Crannell_Advice_on_Writing_Mathematics.pdf?raw=1){:target="_blank"} by Prof. Annalisa Crannell of Franklin & Marshall College.
  (The advice in this document is very basic, so I recommended it mostly to students taking their very first proof-based course.)
