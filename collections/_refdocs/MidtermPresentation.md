# Guidelines for midterm presentation

Presentations will take place on *Monday 23* and *Wednesday 25 March* (right after midterm break).
The schedule will be set shortly.
The presentation must meet the following requirements:

## Choice of topic

Most topics related to *mathematical aspects of AI* are admissible:
- The topic should be an *extension* of concepts in the course;
  it should not be a syllabus topic (unless understood in a broader and deeper sense).
- The mathematical content must be significant.
  Theoretical/foundational topics as well as applied topics (as in applied *math*) are acceptable.

It is highly recommended (but not required) to discuss your choice of topic with the instructor.

## Format of presentation

The presentation will be oral.
- I discourage “blackboard-only” presentations unless you have significant experience (e.g., have given several other similar presentations, or maybe you are a seasoned tutor and good explaining in real time). -->
- You are encouraged to be creative.
  Deep learning has copious concepts that visual explanation:
  include at least one picture or diagram, show a video (but *very* short —no more than 1 minute long!), or prepare a relevant Colab (with at least an image or two) to include as part of the presentation.
  A purely blackboard-based presentation is possible, but not particularly encouraged (if you do a blackboard-only presentation, make double-sure that your handout includes figures or diagrams too detailed to fit into the short format).
- Your presentation should last *8 to 10 minutes*.
  - The 10 minutes limit is **absolute**; you should plan and aim for an *8-minute* presentation.
    There is *no credit to gain* by exceeding 8 minutes —in fact, it is harder to give a good, short and complete presentation than a longer one (which may affect your credit).
  - Any presentation exceeding lasting over 10 minutes will be subject to a **10% credit deduction** for *each additional minute* (or fraction) exceeding the hard 10-minute limit.
  (This is necessitated by the need to fit a dozen presentations into 2 class meetings.)
- At the end of your presentation, there will be a 1–to-2 minute (maximum) interval for questions (Q & A) from the audience related to —or perhaps extending— the material presented.
  You should prepare accordingly!
  - If your presentation is under 9-minutes long, you will have a full 2 minutes for questions;
    if it is over 9 minutes long, the excess will *decrease* your allotted Q & A time.
  - If no other student has a question, there will be an automatic 10% deduction.
    (In this case, the instructor will ask at least 1 question.)
    It is in your best interest to give a *clear and engaging* presentation that will invite and spur student questions!

### Accompanying handouts/supplements

Your presentation must be accompanied by a handout (1 to 2 pages in length), meant to *accompany* and *provide references* to the material presented.
Ideally, the handout will contain some figure(s) to accompany your presentation (particularly if you give a mostly- or purely-blackboard presentation).

Be creative!
As an example (not a requirement!), your handout may include a QR code to a file shared on you Google drive (or Dropbox, or OneDrive…) containing the handout itself in electronic form, or a document or webpage where you put materials (e.g., links to videos presented, to web references, to a shared Colab, etc.)

## Grading
 - [10%] Choice of topic (interesting, relevant, of suitable sophistication for an upper-level undergrad/grad student).
 - [40%] Technical content (correctness, coherence, completeness).
 - [25%] Delivery (manner of execution of presentation:  format, polish, flow, audience engagement)l
 - [25%] Handout (originality, suitability, quality of execution
 
*Bonus: Up to +10% credit.* Include a couple (or, at least, a good one) of “hands-on”/exploratory/inviting/challenging questions or activities for the reader.
If your activity includes significant coding of your own, up to another +10% may be earned;
e.g., create and share a Colab program (in Python/NumPy/Keras…) to illustrate some concept and integrate into a proposed activity.

Again, be creative!
