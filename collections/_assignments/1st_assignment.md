- Read the [Written Work Guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _refdocs/WrittenWorkGuidelines.md %}) and documents on mathematical writings referenced therein.
  Write a short paragraph (≈5 lines) reflecting on one major error present in your math writing hitherto, and outlining some steps you will take to improve your writing for this course.
  Each written assignment throughout the semester should start with a short 1-paragraph reflection on a *different* issue you have noticed, and outline steps to address it.
  (You will need to continuously revisit the Written Work Guidelines and documents therein referenced.)
