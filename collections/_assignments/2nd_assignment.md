This draft is only meant to help you all get a head start.)

### Warm-up Task
- (Re)read the [Written Work Guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _refdocs/WrittenWorkGuidelines.md %}) and write a short paragraph reflecting on your progress as a technical writer.

### Task I

Log on to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/){:target="_blank"} and open the [Jupyter (iPython) file `numpy-tutorial-svd.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A5U2jgdtyVQZKHIIpqHub6X-aUqD-7mB?usp=sharing).

Make sure to save it to your own Google Drive!
(The link above is to a read-only version of my personal copy of the file).
Afterwards, you should continue work on your own personal copy.
