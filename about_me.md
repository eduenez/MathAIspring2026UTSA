# Mini-Bio of Prof. Eduardo Dueñez

I was born and grew up in Guadalajara, Mexico. I always enjoyed math,
science, languages and literature. I learned a lot of math on my own,
not just by reading and practicing, but also by programming vintage
personal computers during my precollege years.

I finished high school winning the Mexican Mathematics Olympiad
([OMM](http://www.ommenlinea.org/)), and participating in
the
[OIM](http://www.ommenlinea.org/actividades/concursos/concursos-internacionales/olimpiada-iberoamericana-de-matematicas/),
[APMO](http://www.apmo-official.org/) and
[IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/) competitions. I
didn\'t start my higher math education until two years after finishing
high school because I lacked the means. (In Mexico, one cannot borrow
money to attend a public university.) After these struggles, I was very
fortunate to get a scholarship to attend college at [Universidad de
Guanajuato (UG)](https://www.ugto.mx/en/), which has an
outstanding [Department of Mathematics
(DEMAT)](http://www.demat.ugto.mx/) (formerly Facultad de
Matemáticas FAMAT) jointly with [Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas
(CIMAT)](https://cimat.mx/). With great support and
nurturing from professors and mentors at FAMAT and CIMAT, I continued my
studies at [the Department of Mathematics of Princeton
University](https://www.math.princeton.edu/), where
I earned my PhD in 2001 under the supervision of [Prof. Peter
Sarnak](https://www.math.princeton.edu/people/peter-sarnak).

After holding postdoctoral positions at the [American Institute of
Mathematics](https://aimath.org/) and [The Johns Hopkins
University](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/), I joined the
[faculty of UTSA in
2004](https://math.utsa.edu/directory/). I am the mentor
and coach of UTSA students entering the yearly [Putnam Mathematical
Competition](https://www.maa.org/math-competitions/putnam-competition),
in which UTSA's team has proudly attained Top-50 ranking on several
occasions among 500+ institutions of higher education in the US and
Canada. I have coached many [students entering math
competitions](https://www.aaas.org/news/math-students-trained-aaas-compete-and-collaborate-mexican-olympiad)
at the middle, high-school and college levels. I remain an avid
enthusiast solver of mathematical problems. I was editor of
[Mathematics
Magazine](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/mathematics-magazine)\'s
[Problems
column](https://mathematicsmagazine.submittable.com/submit)
for a four-year term (2016 to 2019). (If you are curious to see what the
Problems column looks like, here is a link to the [June 2019
issue](https://www-tandfonline-com.libweb.lib.utsa.edu/doi/full/10.1080/0025570X.2019.1599245).
Library login using your UTSA abc123 ID is required.) I belong to the
[American Mathematical Society
(AMS)](https://www.ams.org/), the [Mathematical
Association of America (MAA)](https://www.maa.org/), the
[Association for Symbolic Logic
(ASL)](http://aslonline.org/), and the [Society for the
Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science
(SACNAS)](https://www.sacnas.org/).

At UTSA, I enjoy working with students committed to receiving the best
education in mathematics I can provide. I have supervised, or
co-supervised, independent research projects and theses of undergraduate
and graduate math students over the years, on topics including
[cryptography](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6y2qlrt0etpryy/crypto_work.pdf?raw=1),
[wavelets](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pmk8sid8pyody24/Crystall_Hull-Wavelets.pdf?raw=1),
[representation
theory](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1n093p788s0j1hq/dalthesis.pdf?raw=1),
[L-functions](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8c8rk23p7amcdjg/ElkinTesis.pdf?raw=1),
[elliptic
curves,](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0hex7qtl4z5ahvk/zachsthesisAGAIN.pdf?raw=1)
[random matrix
theory](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u7k464ef45dmgwk/Galindo-Matrices_aleatorias_y_funciones-L.pdf?raw=1),
and [computational aspects of random
matrices](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n7urupevqsv2363/QuatRMtalk.pdf?raw=1).
I particularly like teaching [foundations of math and
analysis](https://cocalc.com/share/94fad72809369ac50d800e9a7704d378acb44c46/repos/foundations/Duenez-Tavernini-NotesFoundationsMathAnalysis.pdf?raw=1)
since they fall right within my research interests, but I enjoy teaching
a broad spectrum of courses, from undergraduate courses like calculus,
linear algebra and foundations of mathematics, to graduate courses in
analysis and number theory. I look forward to teaching courses in our
traditional math programs as well as the new undergraduate program
(joint between math and computer science) on [Mathematics of Data and
Computing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ZeyCINv1PLjJsGBu1ABiQKLXGlgzQ3kLmUH7wzKH7s/edit?usp=sharing).
